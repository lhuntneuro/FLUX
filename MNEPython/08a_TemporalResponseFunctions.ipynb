    "# Temporal response functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal response functions (TRFs) are an alternative approach to understanding the relationship between stimulus events and M/EEG activity. The idea is to estimate a general linear model, with each row of the design matrix capturing a temporally-lagged version of the regressor of interest (Crosse 2016, Ehinger 2019). This can be used for discrete events (as in the current study), but can also be used for continuous, time-evolving regressors. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of this approach is that it allows for 'unmixing' of temporally-overlapping neural responses to an event (Smith 2015). On the other hand, if events are sufficiently temporally separated and discrete, then it is mathematically equivalent to event related averaging. The results from this approach should therefore be equivalent to those identifed in the EventRelatedFields notebook.\n",
